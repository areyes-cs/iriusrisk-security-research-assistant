Tampering: Modifying something on disk, network, memory, or elsewhere. Repudiation: Claiming that you didn't do something or were not responsible; can be honest or false. Information Disclosure: Providing information to someone not authorized to access it. Denial of Service: Exhausting resources needed to provide service. Elevation of Privilege: Allowing someone to do something they are not authorized to do. Lateral movement: Expanding control over the target network beyond the initial point of compromise"

This aspect focuses on complexities such as integrating the security measure with existing systems, customizing and configuring it to meet the organization's needs, requiring technical expertise and training, assessing performance impact, ensuring scalability and flexibility, addressing interoperability and interconnectivity issues, and conducting thorough testing and validation before deployment. Organizations need to consider these technical aspects to effectively implement security countermeasures and enhance their cybersecurity posture. The answer must be one of the following values: 2 for high cost, 1 for medium cost and 0 for low cost. For example, 0 would be returned if the countermeasure is about changing a variable from true to false, 1 would be returned if it's about implementing a complex function, and 2 would be returned if the countermeasure is about setting a complex policy that affects several elements in a software architecture e.g. security policies"
